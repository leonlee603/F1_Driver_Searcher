    "bio":"‘Still I Rise’ – these are the words emblazoned across the back of Lewis Hamilton’s helmet and tattooed across his shoulders, and ever since annihilating expectations with one of the greatest rookie performances in F1 history in 2007, that’s literally all he’s done: risen to the top of the all-time pole positions list ahead of his hero Ayrton Senna, surged into second place in the wins column behind only the inimitable Michael Schumacher, and surpassed the legendary Sir Jackie Stewart for the most championship titles by a British driver."

    "shortname":"Valtteri_Bottas",
    "team":"Mercedes",
    "bio":"Making his F1 debut with Williams in 2013, Bottas soon became part of the family. Points and podiums followed with the reliable racer even amassing the most points without a win, a record he resented but that showcased his ability. The fact the Finn was such a points machine saw him suddenly promoted to the most coveted seat in F1 - Nico Rosberg’s vacant championship-winning seat at Mercedes."

    "name":"Max Verstappen",
    "shortname":"Max_Verstappen",
    "team":"Red Bull Racing",
    "bio":"He’s Max by name, and max by nature. F1’s youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner – at the age of 18 years and 228 days – with an opportunistic but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming."

    "name":"Alexander Albon",
    "shortname":"Alexander_Albon",
    "team":"Red Bull Racing",
    "bio":"Born in London but racing under the flag of Thailand, Alexander Albon’s first word was in fact Italian – and that word was Ferrari. Idolising Michael Schumacher and dreaming of one day racing in Formula 1, Albon got his wish with another team from Italy. After a patient wait for his big break, Albon did his talking on track with Toro Rosso in 2019's opening races, earning a mid-season promotion to Red Bull Racing."

    "name":"Sebastian Vettel",
    "shortname":"Sebastian_Vettel",
    "team":"Ferrari",
    "bio":"Born and raised a Bull, but now very much a Prancing Horse, F1's poster boy of early achievement had won more than all but two drivers in history by the time he was just 26, including back-to-back world titles between 2010 and 2013. Vettel’s trademark is pure pace – and of course his one-finger victory salute. In the chase to the chequered flag, he likes to lead from the front and just like his hero, Michael Schumacher, Vettel has settled in as a race-winning leader at Ferrari."

    "name":"Charles Leclerc",
    "shortname":"Charles_Leclerc",
    "team":"Ferrari",
    "bio":"Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on a tidal wave of expectation. Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories – even when his car caught fire twice at Silverstone – to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing. "

    "team":"McLaren",
    "bio":"He’s the matador from Madrid racing royalty. Entering F1’s Bull Ring paired alongside Max Verstappen at Toro Rosso in 2015, Sainz quickly showed his fighting spirit. A tenacious racer, Sainz puts the car on the edge as he hustles his way through the pack. No wonder he’s earned the nickname Chilli."

    "name":"Lando Norris",
    "shortname":"Lando_Norris",
    "team":"McLaren",
    "bio":"Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian - his Mum just liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting spirit in bountiful supply. McLaren had the British teenager on their books for two years before fast-tracking him into F1’s galaxy of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris didn’t let them down."

  {
    "name":"Sergio Perez",
    "shortname":"Sergio_Perez",
    "team":"Racing Point",
    "bio":"He’s the fighter with a gentle touch from the land of the Lucha Libre. Perez’s reputation in F1 has been built on opposite approaches to Grand Prix racing. On the one hand, he is a punchy combatant who wrestles his way through the pack and into the points. Never afraid to add a bit of spice to his on-track encounters, even his team mates don’t always escape the Mexican’s heat."

    "name":"Lance Stroll",
    "shortname":"Lance_Stroll",
    "team":"Racing Point",
    "bio":"Stroll meant business in his debut 2017 season, setting records on the way. An opportunistic racer he bounded onto the podium in Baku, the youngest rookie to do so. As the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, Stroll is used to a champagne lifestyle but now he knows the fizz tastes all the sweeter on the rostrum. Then in Monza he mastered the downpours to become the youngest driver in history to line up on the front row."

    "name":"Daniel Ricciardo",
    "shortname":"Daniel_Ricciardo",
    "team":"Renault",
    "bio":"The self-styled “Honey Badger” is fuzzy on the outside and feisty on the inside. Drivers beware because behind Ricciardo’s laidback persona and big grin is a razor-sharp racer with a bite. The Australian combines all-out speed with impressive race craft. Never afraid to push to the limits if it means pulling off a pass, Ricciardo is a proven race-winner for Red Bull, capable of consistently finishing at the business end of the championship table."

    "name":"Esteban Ocon",
    "shortname":"Esteban_Ocon",
    "team":"Renault",
    "bio":"If there’s one word that dominates Esteban Ocon’s career, it’s ‘sacrifice’. Back when he was just a promising karter, Ocon’s parents sold their house, put their jobs on hold, and began a life on the road, living in a caravan and travelling from circuit to circuit to support their son’s burgeoning career."

    "team":"AlphaTauri",
    "bio":"If there’s one man who knows how big a rollercoaster ride an F1 driver’s career can be, it’s Pierre Gasly! The flying Frenchman was called up to make his 2017 debut in Malaysia in place of Daniil Kvyat and, after proving his mettle, he was named a Toro Rosso driver the following year.  A further 21 races into his fledgling career, Gasly was moved up again – this time to replace Red Bull big gun Daniel Ricciardo."

  {
    "name":"Daniil Kvyat",
    "shortname":"Daniil_Kvyat",
    "team":"AlphaTauri",
    "bio":"He’s the comeback kid with a capital K. Proving even ‘torpedoes’ can make U-turns, Daniil Kvyat made a surprise F1 return for a third spell with Toro Rosso in 2019. His intrinsic speed and ability to adapt to circuit conditions make him a valuable asset - and he’s a proven podium contender. The rangy Russia arrived in Formula 1 with an impervious poker face and set about his business as a cool and confident racer."

    "name":"Kevin Magnussen",
    "shortname":"Kevin_Magnussen",
    "team":"Haas",
    "bio":"Call him a lone ranger or a maverick, but Magnussen is here for one reason only – to race. He may be a second-generation F1 driver – following his father Jan onto the grid – but Magnussen’s idols are from the ‘golden era’ of Grand Prix racing when the likes of Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss risked it all for the love of the sport. The Roskilde racer’s own prowess was proven on debut for McLaren, who guided him through the junior ranks, when he cruised into the top-three at the Australian Grand Prix, becoming the first Dane to claim a podium in F1."

    "bio":"High-speed haute cuisine is on the menu in the Grosjean household, where head chef Romain is also a racing star. Quick and with a natural feel for braking and balance, Grosjean has the right ingredients to cook up a storm on track. Tussling and hustling at the front of the pack, the French racer claimed a series of impressive podiums for Renault before moving to spearhead the Haas team."

    "shortname":"Kimi_Räikkönen",
    "team":"Alfa Romeo",
    "bio":"He’s the world-famous racing driver who just wants to be left alone. Maybe it’s because of the rugged, raw talent that inspired Sauber to give him his debut in 2001 – and re-sign him for 2019. Or the fast and fearless racing that led to memorable McLaren wins. Or the never-say-die attitude that clinched the 2007 world title for Ferrari by a single point. Or maybe it’s because this is the ‘Iceman’ who jumped straight into a Jacuzzi on his yacht after retiring in Monaco and who enjoyed an ice cream when a soggy Malaysian GP was red-flagged but still live."

    "team":"Williams",
    "bio":"George Russell lived by it in his 2019 debut F1 campaign, out-qualifying seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix, and proving Williams right in identifying him as a hard worker and a tenacious talent. That brilliant baseline speed had served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way to Formula 1. The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure."

    "name":"Nicholas Latifi",
    "shortname":"Nicholas_Latifi",
    "team":"Williams",
    "bio":"That ascension into racing's top category was largely thanks to his most impressive season to date in Formula 2 in 2019, with Latifi – who’d finished a disappointing ninth in the series’ 2018 standings – pulling up his bootstraps to claim second in the championship. That result, combined with the Williams/Robert Kubica union failing to mesh in 2019, meant Williams made the call to promote their affable Canadian reserve driver to a full-time drive alongside George Russell for 2020."
